''' question: What exceptions can be caught by the following handlers?
except IOError ...
except ZeroDivisionError

Answer

except IOError:
This handler catches exceptions of the IOError class, which occurs when there are issues related to input/output operations, such as:
Failure to open a file.
Issues with reading or writing to a file.
Errors related to file or stream operations, such as a file not existing or lacking proper permissions.


Example of an IOError:

python
Copy code
try:
    with open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r") as f:
        data = f.read()
except IOError:
    print("File not found or another IO error occurred!")



2. except ZeroDivisionError:
This handler catches exceptions of the ZeroDivisionError class, which occurs when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero. Common scenarios include:
Dividing by zero in integer or floating-point arithmetic.
Using the modulo operator (%) or floor division operator (//) with zero as the divisor.
Example of a ZeroDivisionError:

python
Copy code
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")
Summary
except IOError:: Handles exceptions related to input/output operations (file handling, etc.).
except ZeroDivisionError:: Handles exceptions caused by division by zero.
These handlers are specific to their respective exception classes and will not catch other exceptions. For example, an IOError handler will not catch a ZeroDivisionError, and vice versa.*/
